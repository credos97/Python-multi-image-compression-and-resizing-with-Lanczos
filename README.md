# Python-multi-image-compression-and-resizing-with-Lanczos

Efficient and fast Python code to reduce drastically images weights, and sizes if needed, thanks to the Lanczos resampling. No loss in quality will be really detectable
if you don't resize your picture (and just compress it).

Just read the # in the code and everything will be fine :)
